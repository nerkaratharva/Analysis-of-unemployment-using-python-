## Introduction
Understanding unemployment trends is crucial for policymakers, economists, and society at large. This project aims to provide insights into unemployment in India through data analysis and visualization. The code provided showcases techniques to explore and visualize unemployment data, helping to identify patterns, trends, and disparities across different regions.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed. You can also install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the provided datasets in the project directory (e.g., "Unemployment in India.csv" and "Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv").
3. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
4. Load and execute the code cells in the provided notebook to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

## Dataset
In this visionary endeavor, we harness the potency of not one, but two extraordinary datasets: "Unemployment in India.csv" and the enigmatic "Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv." These datasets are a treasure trove of invaluable insights, weaving together a narrative of unemployment rates, employment estimations, labor participation revelations, and even the mystical coordinates that anchor the geography of various states in the grand tapestry of India.

## Data Preprocessing
The journey commences with the summoning of our datasets through the mystical powers of pandas. As the data sets foot into our realm, they are met with a ritual of column name standardization. This ensures uniformity and harmony in the realm of data. In our quest for perfection, we confront the ethereal realm of missing values, a challenge we conquer by unveiling the count of null entities residing in each column. Through these rituals, we cleanse the data, preparing it for the epic journey that lies ahead.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Here, we embark on an odyssey of exploration, unearthing hidden gems of insight from the heart of the datasets. The enchanted tool of seaborn weaves its magic to conjure correlation heatmaps, a canvas that paints the interwoven relationships between variables with strokes of fiery insight. As these visual incantations unfold, patterns and connections that elude the ordinary eye come to life, revealing the intricate symphony played by the dataset's variables.

Through these unparalleled feats, the project paves the way for a greater understanding of the enigmatic phenomenon of unemployment. Each stage is a step towards unraveling the mysteries that the data holds, ultimately empowering us to shape strategies, policies, and decisions that can transform the landscape of employment in the vast and diverse expanse of India.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations are generated to present the unemployment data effectively:
- A histogram showing the distribution of estimated employment across different regions.
- A sunburst plot depicting unemployment rates across states and regions in India.
